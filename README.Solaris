Some notes on compling GtkLP on Solaris Systems.
------------------------------------------------
Sometimes the compilation fails on some Solaris Systems cause configure
doesn't add all libs.

Try 
     ./configure LDFLAGS=-lX11
or
     ./configure LDFLAGS=-lX11 -lintl
to solve those problems.

Have luck!
