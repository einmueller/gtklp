Some notes on compling GtkLP on Irix Systems. 
---------------------------------------------
There are problems compiling gtklp-1.0c under IRIX 6.5.22f, cause
"basename" was not found when linking gtklp.
Please use 
   ./configure LDFLAGS=-lgen
to solve this Problem.

Also the fonts could look a little big ugly with Gtk2. In this
case you should use Gtk1 instead:
   ./configure --enable-gtk1 LDFLAGS=-lgen

Thanks to Dirk Engel for this hints!
