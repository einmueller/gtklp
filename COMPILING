Requirements
------------
To install, you'll need at least:

    * gtk+ 1.2.8 from gtk.org
    * glib 1.2.8 from gtk.org
    * cups 1.10 from cups.org

Maybe it works with different versions too, but it's not tested.
If you use rpm-packages, don`t forget to install also the devel-packages !

Installation
------------
Since version 0.9d you should be able to do it the following way:

    * unpack source-code
    * execute an ./configure
    * execute an make or gmake
    * execute an make install or gmake install

If you want to install it to special locations, or if you have installed cups, or gtk to unusual places, please fiddle around with the command-line options of configure. You can see all options by executing ./configure --help.
If configure fails on your system, try to edit Makefile.fallback and use make -f Makefile.fallback && make -f Makefile.fallback install or gmake -f Makefile.fallback && gmake -f Makefile.fallback install.
... or just use some of the precompiled packages !

Languages
---------
Since version 0.9d GtkLP uses gettext, so the language of your interface depends on the environment-variables LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES and LANG.
If your language is not support right now, please

    * Get the german po-file
    * Rename it to fit to your language
    * Translate every german msgstr to your language
    * Send me this translated file
    * Thank you very much !
