1) I need more than xxx printers!
=================================

GtkLP before version 1.0g:
--------------------------
You have to change the value of #define MAX_PRT 100 in include/defaults.h
*before* compiling GtkLP.

newer versions:
---------------
You have to configure GtkLP with "./configure --maxprinters=xxx" before doing the "make".
That will lead to a version that supports xxx printers.
